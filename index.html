    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>I am a motivated individual who works hard to ensure I fully understand all the requirements, ensuring I fulfil the expectations of my customers. I am trusted to work individually with minimal
        supervision, however I also enjoy working with others by utilising effective team
        relationships. I am a creative yet analytical thinker who uses these abilities to identify
        key issues and work towards resolutions that will benefit the bankâ€™s customers and
        my role. I also take pride and personal satisfaction in having the flexibility to adapt
        well to change, which I feel is a necessary quality in any given work environment.
